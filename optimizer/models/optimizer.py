    Optimize the portfolio to reduce Active Share while applying constraints.
    
    Parameters:
    - stocks_data: DataFrame containing stock data
    - original_active_share: Original Active Share percentage
    - num_positions: Exact number of positions required in the portfolio
    - target_active_share: Target Active Share percentage
    - sector_tolerance: Maximum allowed deviation from benchmark sector weights (in decimal)
    - stocks_to_avoid: List of ticker symbols to exclude from the portfolio
    - sector_constraints: Dictionary mapping sector-and-subsector to target weights
    - min_position: Minimum position size as a percentage (e.g., 1.0)
    - max_position: Maximum position size as a percentage (e.g., 5.0)
    - core_rank_limit: Only consider stocks with Core Model rank <= this value (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    - increment: Allowed increment for position sizes (e.g., 0.5 for 0.5% increments)
    - forced_positions: Dictionary {ticker: (min, max)}. For each ticker, require it to be in the portfolio with weight between min and max.
    - time_limit: Maximum time allowed for the solver (in seconds)
    - locked_tickers: Dictionary {ticker: weight}. For each ticker, require it to be in the portfolio with exactly its current weight.
