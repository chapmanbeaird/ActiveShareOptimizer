# Active Share Optimizer

An interactive portfolio optimization tool that helps portfolio managers adjust their stock holdings to achieve a target Active Share while respecting sector, position size, and other constraints. Powered by PuLP and the CBC Solver for mixed-integer linear programming optimization.

## üåü Features

- **Portfolio Analysis**: Load your current portfolio and benchmark weights from a CSV file
- **Constraint Management**: Import constraints like restricted stocks and sector targets from Excel
- **Interactive UI**: Adjust all parameters through an intuitive Streamlit web interface

     - Open "Edit the system environment variables" from Control Panel
     - Click "Environment Variables"
     - Edit the "Path" variable and add the CBC bin directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\CBC\bin`)

3. **Clone the repository**
   - Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
   - Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ActiveShareOptimizer.git
   cd ActiveShareOptimizer
   ```

4. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

5. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Alternative Installation: Using Conda (Mac or Windows)

1. **Install Miniconda**
   - Download and install from [docs.conda.io](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

2. **Create and activate a conda environment**
   ```bash
   conda create -n activeshare python=3.11
   conda activate activeshare
   ```

3. **Install CBC solver and dependencies**
   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge coincbc
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application

1. **Start the web app**
   ```bash
   # For Mac/Linux
   streamlit run app.py
   
   # For Windows
   python -m streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Open your browser** to the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501)

3. **Upload your files**:
   - Portfolio CSV (e.g., `active_share_with_core_constraints.csv`)
   - Constraints Excel (e.g., `stocks_to_avoid&sector_constraints.xlsm`)

4. **Adjust parameters in the sidebar** and click "Run Optimizer"

## üìä Input File Formats

### Portfolio CSV Format
Your CSV file should include the following columns:
- `Ticker` - Stock ticker symbol
- `Portfolio Weight` - Current weight in your portfolio (%)
- `Bench Weight` - Weight in the benchmark (%)
- `Sector` - Stock sector
- `Sector-and-Subsector` - More detailed sector/industry classification
- `Core Model` - Ranking or scoring of stocks (lower is better)

### Constraints Excel Format
Your Excel file should have sheets with:
- `Stocks to Avoid` column - List of tickers to exclude
- `Emp Sector & Industry` column - Sector constraints to target
- `Weight` column - Target weight for the sector

## ‚öôÔ∏è Optimizer Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Max Positions** | Maximum number of stocks allowed in the portfolio |
| **Target Active Share (%)** | Minimum difference from benchmark (higher = more different) |
| **Sector Tolerance (%)** | How much sector weights can deviate from targets |
| **Min/Max Position Size (%)** | Bounds for individual stock position sizes |
| **Max Core Model Rank** | Only include stocks with Core rank <= this value |
| **Position Size Mode** | Choose continuous weights or discrete increments |
| **Position Increment Size (%)** | Step size for position sizing (if using discrete mode) |
| **Solver Timeout (seconds)** | Maximum time allowed for optimization |

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CBC Solver not found**
   - Make sure CBC is installed and in your system PATH
   - For Windows, check that you added the CBC bin directory to the PATH
   - For macOS, verify installation with `brew info cbc`

2. **Infeasible solution**
   - Try increasing sector tolerance
   - Lower the target active share
   - Adjust or remove forced positions
   - Check if the combination of constraints is too restrictive

3. **Streamlit interface not loading**
   - Check if port 8501 is already in use
   - Try running with a different port: `streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502`

4. **Slow optimization**
   - Increase the timeout setting for complex problems
   - Consider reducing the number of constraints
   - Simplify sector constraints
